### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read [PLANNING.md](mdc:PLANNING.md) ** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check [TASK.md](mdc:TASK.md) before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in [PLANNING.md](mdc:PLANNING.md).

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in [TASK.md](mdc:TASK.md) immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to [TASK.md](mdc:TASK.md) under a “Discovered During Work” section.
