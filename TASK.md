### ✅ Optimize project flag filters - 2025-10-01

**Task**: Fix 504 error on `isPastProject=true` with multiple flags; make all boolean flag filters work together efficiently
**Description**: Updated `src/api/project/controllers/project.ts` to resolve boolean flag aliases (slug/name) to category IDs once, and filter by relation IDs instead of large `$or` conditions. This avoids heavy queries and supports combining multiple flags like `isMarketRate=true&isNewConstruction=true&isPastProject=true` without timeouts. Also kept default sorting/pagination/populate behavior intact.
**Impact**: Prevents gateway timeouts, improves performance, and allows multiple filters to be used together reliably.
